# CS-4348-Scheduler
**About:** A program to simulate different short term scheduling algortithms

The scheduler is a class that holds a list of processes to be ran. And different methods per algorithm

### Analyisis for each algorithm:

#### First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- **Possibilty of Starvation:**
  
- **Effect of context switching overhead on throughput:**

- **Fairness:**


#### Round Robin
- **Possibilty of Starvation:**
  
- **Effect of context switching overhead on throughput:**

- **Fairness:**


#### Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
- **Possibilty of Starvation:**
  
- **Effect of context switching overhead on throughput:**

- **Fairness:**


#### Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
- **Possibilty of Starvation:**
  
- **Effect of context switching overhead on throughput:**

- **Fairness:**
